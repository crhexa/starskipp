StarSkipp
=========

**StarSkipp** is a 2D strategy game about exploring the cosmos to seed distant worlds with human life. 

Despite making leaps and bounds in technological advances, humanity has not yet found a way to traverse the stars in survivable timescales. The only feasible option then, is to send you: a sentient artificial intelligence capable of surviving the millenia-long journey to other stars, and the means to gestate humans once the destination has been reached.

Your objective is to manage limited resources to survey potentially habitable worlds, construct infrastructure and industry, terraform inhospitable environments to support a thriving biosphere, and finally, nurture human civilization from scratch.
